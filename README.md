What I means by manuscript of mine is my handwritting about mathematics. 
It is included excercise, proofs, and my notebooks. You cites my handwritting in your paper or something else if you are include
my names (https://github.com/m-RezaFahlevi/Mathematica-Works) in it. I think it is fun to share my handwritting to worlds as my
appreciation and my interest in Mathematica.
